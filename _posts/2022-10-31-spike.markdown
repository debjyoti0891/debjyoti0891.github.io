**Assumption**: The `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu` toolchain is already built and availble on the PATH. 

## Install [DTC](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/device-tree-compiler/?h=applied/debian/sid)
The device tree compiler (dtc) executable is a requirement for spike. It can be compiled from scratch.
The binary should be available in the PATH environment variable. 

## Install [ProxyKernel](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-pk)
``` 
mkdir build
cd build 
../configure --prefix=<install prefix> --host=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu
make -j all
make install
```
### Note
- If you try to build in the root of the repository, the output file for `pk` does not get generated, as there is a directory with the same name. Hence, using a build folder helps!

## Install [spike](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim). 

``` 
./configure --prefix=<install prefix> --with-boost=<path to boost root> --enable-commitlog --with-isa=RV64IMAFDCP 
make -j all
make install
``` 

### Note: 
- In my specific installation, Boost libraries could not be found
    even after setting appropriate LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Explictly specifiying the path solved the issue.
- Take a look at the output of `./configure --help` to find options that might be relevant. For example, `--enable-commitlog` was something that was relevant for me. 

## Spike Execution 

### Creating the executable

``` riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o hello hello.c```

### Actual execution
To run spike with a baremetal program and log the commits to a file:

```
spike  -m 1G --log-commits --log=spike_log.txt $(\which pk) hello 
```
