* #### Compute Simulation Infrastructure
    * _Sparta_: Sparta is a toolkit for modeling/simulation engineers to build CPU, GPU, and platform simulations. 
        * Webpage: <https://github.com/sparcians/map/tree/master/sparta>
    * _SST_ : The Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) was developed to explore innovations in highly concurrent systems where the ISA, microarchitecture, and memory interact with the programming model and communications system.
        * Webpage: <http://sst-simulator.org/>
    * _Flamegraph_ : Tool to visualize perf events
        * Webpage: <https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph>
    * _Microsoft NNI_: This framework can be used for sytemetically performing Design Space Exploration (with relatively low efforts), even though it is originally intended for neural network exploration.
        * Webpage: <https://github.com/microsoft/nni>
    * _Accelergy_ : This is a energy/area estimation methodology for accelerators that allows design specifications comprised of user-defined high-level compound components and user-defined low-level primitive components, which can be characterized by external tools/plugins.
        * Webpage: <https://accelergy.mit.edu/>


* #### Command line programs
    * _ABC_ : ABC is a popular tool in the design automation community. It provides a comphrensive command line system for logic synthesis as well as verification.
        * Webpage: <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/>

    * _trash-cli_ : This is an alternative to _rm_ tool for deleting files on the linux file system. Deleted files are cached and can be retrieved if possible. 
        * Webpage: <https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli>

* #### Neural Network tools
    * Netron :
        Netron is a viewer for neural network and capable of visualizing neural network models generated by a variety of deep learning frameworks, including ONNX, Caffe2, MXNet, etc.
        * Webpage : <https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron>

* #### Python libraries
    * Igraph : 
        Igraph is a graph library that has multiple bindings available (including python, R, etc.) The library is well documented and can be used without a steep learning curve. 
        * Webpage : <https://igraph.org/python/doc/tutorial/tutorial.html>
    * z3-solver: Z3 is a theorem prover from Microsoft Research with support for bitvectors, booleans, arrays, floating point numbers, strings, and other data types. This is a great tool for solving SAT and other optimization problems.  
        * Webpage : <https://pypi.org/project/z3-solver/>
